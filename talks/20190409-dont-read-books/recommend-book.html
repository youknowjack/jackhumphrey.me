      Hi Jack
    </div>

    <div>

    <div>
      A random question: is there a book on management which you
      feel influenced you the most? Can recommend something?
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      Thanks in advance
    </div>

    Not really. I've been more influenced by people than books.
    Role models, mentors, etc.

    I often find that most books on leadership and management can
    be distilled down into a few pieces of advice. I've found it
    pretty effective to see if I understand the advice intuitively,
    and if I do, I try it to follow it. If that works well, I put
    it in my manager toolkit. A few examples from through the
    years:
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Show people you care about them as individuals</li>

    <li>Value all ideas</li>

    <li>Don't micromanage</li>

    <li>Give people the tools, support, and autonomy to solve their
    own problems</li>

    <li>Reframe problems as opportunities</li>

    <li>Focus on removing roadblocks</li>

    <li>Ask questions -- prefer a question to a statement</li>

    <li>Encourage forward thinking and goal setting (even if only
    just goals for the next week)</li>

    <li>Build on strength; shore up weakness</li>

    <li>Flex your management style to fit the needs of the
    individual</li>

    <li>Give critical feedback with compassion</li>

    <li>Ask people to help you see your own blindspots</li>
  </ul>

  <div>
    I left a bunch off, that's just a top-of-mind sampling. And I'm
    still learning. I have my own blindspots, still.
  </div>

  <div>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div>
    I don't think that any book fully encompasses my toolkit, but I
    do think that Google's Project Oxygen comes pretty close:
    <a href=
    "https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/learn-about-googles-manager-research/"
    target="_blank">What Makes a Great Manager</a>. I guess you can
    buy the <a href=
    "https://hbr.org/product/google-s-project-oxygen-do-managers-matter/313110-PDF-ENG"
    target="_blank">full-length case study</a>, but I haven't
    actually read it.

    Also, people I respect strongly recommend Camille Fournier's
    book "The Manager's Path."
